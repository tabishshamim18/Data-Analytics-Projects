# 🏥 Patient Experience & Hospital Performance Analysis — KPI Dashboard for Healthcare

## 📝 Executive Summary
Hospitals today face increasing pressure to deliver high-quality care while maintaining operational efficiency. At **Lowell General Hospital**, improving **patient satisfaction and safety** is a top priority. However, multiple operational factors — such as **bed occupancy**, **staff responsiveness**, and **fall rates** — influence patient outcomes, making it essential to have a **data-driven view** of performance.

In this project, I analyzed key hospital KPIs and built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to uncover:
- How **staff responsiveness** impacts **unassisted fall rates** and patient experience.  
- Seasonal and long-term **trends in occupancy and responsiveness**.  
- Benchmark comparisons to evaluate performance over time.  

📊 **Key Insights:**  
- **Occupancy Rate:** 96.22% average  
- **Staff Responsiveness:** 63.09% (below benchmark in multiple periods)  
- **Fall %:** 26.08% overall, with a **2.61 unassisted fall rate**  
- Clear **negative correlation** between staff responsiveness and fall rates — faster response times are associated with fewer patient falls.

✅ **Business Impact:** The dashboard provides hospital leadership with a **clear performance view**, enabling **targeted operational improvements** that can directly improve **patient safety and satisfaction**.

## 💼 Business Problem
Lowell General Hospital is committed to providing exceptional patient care and ensuring high satisfaction levels. However, rising patient expectations and operational pressures make it difficult to identify which **operational metrics** most strongly influence **patient experience and safety**.  

Specifically, the hospital needed to:
- Identify **key drivers of patient satisfaction and safety**.  
- Explore relationships between KPIs such as **occupancy**, **staff responsiveness**, and **fall rates**.  
- Benchmark performance over time to find **areas needing improvement**.

Without a structured, data-driven approach, decision-making is slower and often based on intuition rather than facts.

## 🧭 Methodology
Here’s a concise overview of the steps taken in the project:

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Collected hospital operational and patient experience data.
   - Cleaned and standardized fields such as dates, scores, and rates.

2. **KPI Definition**
   - Defined key measures like **Occupancy Rate**, **Staff Responsiveness Score**, **Fall %**, and **Unassisted Fall Rate**.
   - Created benchmarks to compare against actual performance over time.

3. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Analyzed **trends over time** to identify seasonal patterns and anomalies.
   - Examined **correlations** between staff responsiveness and patient fall rates.

4. **Dashboard Design**
   - Developed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** with filters for **Year** and **Month**.
   - Included trend charts, benchmarks, scatterplots, and heatmaps for better storytelling.

5. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Interpreted patterns to provide **operational recommendations** for staff planning and quality improvement.

## 📈 Results & Business Recommendations

### 🟢 **Key Findings**
- **High Occupancy (96.22%)** maintained throughout the year with visible monthly fluctuations.  
- **Staff responsiveness (63%)** often lagged behind benchmark scores — particularly in specific months, impacting patient experience.  
- **Unassisted fall rates** showed a **strong negative correlation** with responsiveness — lower responsiveness scores were associated with higher fall rates.  
- Seasonal trends highlighted certain months with **sharp drops in responsiveness**, indicating staffing or workload challenges.

### 🧭 **Recommendations**
1. 📅 **Staff Planning**  
   - Increase staffing or optimize shift allocation during months where responsiveness dips.

2. 🏥 **Training & Awareness**  
   - Conduct targeted staff training in low-performing months to improve responsiveness scores.

3. 📊 **Performance Monitoring**  
   - Set monthly benchmarks and track staff responsiveness more granularly.

4. 🚨 **Patient Safety Initiatives**  
   - Implement fall prevention protocols in wards with low responsiveness scores.

5. 🔄 **Continuous Feedback Loop**  
   - Integrate real-time feedback systems for staff responsiveness to act quickly on patient needs.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Automate **data refresh pipelines** to keep the dashboard live and updated.  
- Add **department-level filters** to identify performance differences within hospital units.  
- Integrate **patient feedback scores** for a richer view of patient experience.  
- Apply **predictive models** to flag high-risk periods for falls or low responsiveness.
