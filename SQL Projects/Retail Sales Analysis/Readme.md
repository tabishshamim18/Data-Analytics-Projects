# 🧾 Retail Sales & Customer Insights Analysis — SQL Data Analytics Project

## 📝 Executive Summary
Retail businesses generate vast amounts of data every day — from customer orders to product sales and regional performance. However, without proper analysis, this data remains untapped, leaving businesses with missed opportunities to understand their **customers**, **products**, and **overall performance**.

In this project, I worked with a **data warehouse backup** and wrote a series of **SQL scripts** to extract key business insights from raw transactional data. The goal was to replicate a **real-world analytics scenario**, focusing on customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends.

📊 **Key Highlights:**
- Developed multiple SQL reports to analyze **customer activity**, **product performance**, and **sales patterns**.  
- Applied **advanced SQL techniques** (joins, CTEs, window functions, aggregations) to solve practical business questions.  
- Designed **scalable queries** that can be integrated into dashboards or BI tools for regular reporting.

✅ **Business Impact:** The insights from this project can help a retail business identify **top-performing products**, **high-value customers**, and **areas of improvement**, driving smarter marketing and inventory decisions.

## 💼 Business Problem
Retail companies often have large volumes of data sitting in their databases but lack the structure to **turn it into meaningful insights**.  

The challenges typically include:
- Identifying **who the most valuable customers** are.  
- Understanding **which products drive the most revenue**.  
- Analyzing **sales performance across regions, time, and categories**.  
- Detecting trends and anomalies to **support decision-making**.

This project aims to address these challenges by using **SQL as the primary tool** to analyze data directly from a data warehouse and produce **actionable insights**.

## 🧭 Methodology
Here’s a brief overview of the approach I followed:

1. **Data Understanding & Setup**
   - Restored the provided `.bak` file to Microsoft SQL Server to access structured data.
   - Explored tables, relationships, and key fields.

2. **Data Exploration**
   - Analyzed tables related to **Customers**, **Products**, **Sales**, **Orders**, and **Regions**.
   - Identified KPIs and metrics relevant for reporting.

3. **SQL Query Development**
   - Wrote structured SQL scripts to answer analytical questions, including:
     - Total revenue by product category and region  
     - Top customers by total spend and frequency  
     - Product performance over time  
     - Monthly and quarterly revenue trends

4. **Aggregation & Reporting**
   - Used advanced SQL features to generate clean, summarized reports suitable for dashboards or business presentations.

5. **Insight Generation**
   - Interpreted query outputs to highlight trends, top performers, and strategic opportunities.
